// NFGUARD-1 (POLISHFIX-8): content-equivalence check for the nonfiction polish
// path. Two texts are "polish-equivalent" when they differ only by quote glyphs
// (straight vs curly), whitespace, and collapsed runs of identical punctuation
// (",," → ","; " ," → ","). Everything else — a deleted appositive comma, a
// swapped word, a merged or rewritten sentence — is a CONTENT change. Three
// deterministic rewrite passes each independently damaged real nonfiction prose
// (POLISHFIX-7 and the run after it); on nonfiction, polish may fix typography
// and nothing else, and this predicate is what enforces it.
